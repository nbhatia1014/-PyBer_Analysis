# Overview:
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create a complete summary of the Ride-Sharing data by city type. To help support our findings, we created charts using the Matplotlib libraries. We used statistical outputs, such as mean, in order to support our analysis.

# Results:

Shown above is the DataFrame. On average the rural areas had the higher average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver. The suburban area had the second highest fare per ridew and average fare per driver. The cheapest average fare per ride and average fare per driver is in the Urban areas. The urban areas also has the most number of total rides and total drivers.

Shown above is the multiple-line chart. The line chart shows that the urban area is the most profitable of the city types. In addition, some of the fares spike during the same time periods for all three city types.

# Summary:
In summary, the Urban area generates the most revenue of the three city types. This is because of the increased amount of rides which increasesed the total fare. However, when  analyzing the other two environments (Rural and Suburban) the lack of rides and drives and the increased average fares signify that these city environemts will need additional drivers to help cut costs for the passengers.
